        <h1>Boromir</h1>
        <img src="/img/boromir.jpg">
        <p>Boromir is a noble character who believes passionately in the greatness of his kingdom, who would have defended its people to the last. Boromir's great stamina and physical strength, together with a forceful and commanding personality, made him a widely admired commander in Gondor's army: he was made Captain of the White Tower, and quickly became Captain-General, also bearing the title High Warden of the White Tower. Boromir led many successful forays against Sauron's forces, prior to his journey north to Rivendell, which brought him great esteem in his eyes of his father, Denethor. Boromir's pursuit of the Ring came to an end with his heroic acts to protect Merry and Pippin from the advancing orcs near Parth Galen.</p>
